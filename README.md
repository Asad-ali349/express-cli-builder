## Features

- **Generate Models:** Quickly create Mongoose models with predefined schema templates.
- **Create Routes:** Easily set up route files linked to their corresponding controllers.
- **Build Controllers:** Generate controller files to manage application logic and data interactions.
- **Set Up Middlewares:** Create reusable middleware functions for enhanced application functionality.
- **Resource Creation:** Create a full set of model, route, and controller files for rapid development.

## Benefits

- **Consistent Structure:** Ensures a standardized file structure for better organization and maintainability.
- **Time-Saving:** Reduces repetitive boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus on building features.
- **Flexibility:** Customize templates to fit project needs, enhancing code reusability.

## Installation

To install Express CLI globally, run the following command:

```bash

npm install -g express-cli-builder

```
## Usage

Once installed, you can use the command line to generate different components for your Express.js app.

## Create a Model

To generate a **model**, use the following command:
``` bash

express create:model <model-name>

```

This command will create a model in the models folder. If the folder doesnâ€™t exist, it will be created automatically.

## Create a Controller
To generate a **controller**, use the following command:

``` bash
express create:controller <controller-name>
```

This will create a controller in the controllers folder.

## Create a Route
To generate a **route**, use the following command:

``` bash
express create:route <route-name>
```

This will create a route in the routes folder.

## Create a Middleware
To generate a **middleware**, use the following command:

``` bash
express create:middleware <middleware-name>
```

This will create a middleware in the middlewares folder.

## Create a Resource
The resource command will create a **model, route, and controller** with boilerplate code:

``` bash
express create:resource <resource-name>
```

This will create:

The model in the **models** folder.
The controller in the **controllers** folder.
The route in the **routes** folder.
